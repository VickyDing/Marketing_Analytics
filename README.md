In the Market Segmentation project, we consider the data collected in the course of a market-research study using followers of the Twitter account of a large consumer brand that shall remain nameless. The goal here was for the brand to understand its social-media audience a little bit better, so that it could hone its messaging a little more sharply.

For Association Rule Mining, we use the data on grocery purchases and find some interesting association rules for these shopping baskets.
